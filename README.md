# RotateImage
This code rotates image by given angle, Image will be enlarged when rotating and won't cut a part of it

This code mainly focuses on the logic of rotation, adding offset and removing extra offset from rotated image. Code is not optimum for Production as it contains for loops instead of opencv functions. One can use opencv functions to achieve faster results
Others can inspire from the code and re-write it in any language
